Bitcoin

Bitcoin (BTC) is a form of cryptocurrency, which is a type of virtual currency intended to 
function as a medium of exchange and a payment method independent of any single individual, 
organization, or authority. This characteristic eliminates the necessity for reliance on 
trusted intermediaries, such as banks or mints, in financial dealings.

Launched to the public in 2009 by an unidentified developer or collective of developers under 
the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has emerged as the most recognized and largest 
cryptocurrency globally. Its widespread acceptance has led to the creation of numerous 
other cryptocurrencies.
